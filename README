HACKING
=======

1) you can modify the generated code as with any other PHP extension

BUILDING ON UNIX etc.
=====================

To compile your new extension, you will have to execute the following steps:

1.  $ ./phpize
2.  $ ./configure
3.  $ make
4.  $ make test
5.  $ [sudo] make install



BUILDING ON WINDOWS
===================

No windows build is available at the moment

TESTING
=======

You can now load the extension using a php.ini directive

  extension="couchdb.so"

or load it at runtime using the dl() function

  dl("couchdb.so");

The extension should now be available, you can test this
using the extension_loaded() function:

  if (extension_loaded("couchdb"))
    echo "couchdb loaded :)";
  else
    echo "something is wrong :(";

The extension will also add its own block to the output
of phpinfo();
